This is bamazon which is a storefront that uses javascript, npm inquirer, and node js and mysql as a database. <br />

When you type in node bamazonCustomer in the terminal, you will be prompted on whether to buy a product or exit. <br />

Hitting "enter on the buy option will prompt the user to choose an item to buy based on the id number.

Once that happens the program will then prompt the user to select how many units they would like to purchase. <br />

In the image above, I selected the item id equal to 2 and would like to purchase 2 of them, so I get a total price of 50 due to that product being 25 per unit. The database then updates from a stock quantity of 4 to a stock quantity of 2.
